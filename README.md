Steps to run the program

1. Clone from GitHub

2. Run

3. Follow instructions in terminal

The program allows you to import json/yaml file, I left a demo file called restaurant.json in the main folder.

After importing the form you are able to answer the questions and view the filled from.

You will then be asked if you wish to save the file and to which format, json or yaml.
